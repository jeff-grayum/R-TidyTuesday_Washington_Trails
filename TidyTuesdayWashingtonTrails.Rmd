Getting a "feel" for the data.
```{r}

         highpoint = as.numeric(highpoint)) %>%
  rename(park = location) %>%
  view()

#Check to make sure it worked.
hike_data %>%
  str()

hike_data %>%
  view() 

#First, we will make a graph showing the number of trails in the twenty busiest locations.

That was all pretty worthless.  Now lets look at the top rated trails, and see what connects them.
```{r}
top_trails <- hike_data %>%
  arrange(desc(rating)) %>%
  filter(rating >= 4.8) %>%
  view()

top_trails %>%
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, rating)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(rating, name)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(title = "The top rated hiking trails in Washington state",
       x = "Rating",
       y = "Trail",
       caption = "Trails rated out of 5 stars") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(),
        text = element_text(family = "Times New Roman"))

hike_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(gain, highpoint, size = rating, color = )) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```
